# Game of Life
- This is a java implementation of Conway's Game of Life.
- currently it lacks optimization.

## Motivation
- I wanted to learn java, and I stumbled across this video [Etsuko Yakushimaru - “I’m Humanity”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92Dcp9Fbdac) which I found really fascinating and wanted to recreate it.
- Currently only the first part is implement, no maze generation.

## Features
- Ugly UI.

- Predefined patterns.
